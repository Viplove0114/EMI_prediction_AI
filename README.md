# **EMIPredict AI \- Intelligent Financial Risk Assessment Platform**

## **🚀 Live Application**

**You can access the deployed application here:**

[**https://emipredictionai-007.streamlit.app/**](https://emipredictionai-007.streamlit.app/)

This project is a comprehensive, end-to-end financial risk assessment platform built with Streamlit and MLflow. It solves a dual machine learning problem:

1. **Classification:** Predicts a customer's eligibility for an EMI (Eligible, High\_Risk, Not\_Eligible).  
2. **Regression:** Predicts the maximum safe monthly EMI amount a customer can afford.

The application is built around a multi-page Streamlit dashboard that allows for data exploration, full model retraining, and live predictions.

## **🔑 Key Features**

* **Multi-Page Streamlit App:** A clean, interactive UI for all project stakeholders.  
* **📊 Data Explorer:** An EDA dashboard to visualize feature distributions and correlations.  
* **🚀 Model Training Pipeline:** A one-click button to preprocess 400,000 records, train 6 different ML models, and log all results to MLflow.  
* **🔮 Live Prediction:** A real-time prediction form that uses the best-performing models to assess new applicants instantly.  
* **🤖 MLflow Integration:** Complete experiment tracking for all models, including parameters, metrics, and model artifact registration.

## **Problem Statement**

In the FinTech and Banking domain, many people struggle to pay EMIs due to poor financial planning and inadequate risk assessment. This project aims to solve this critical issue by providing data-driven insights for better loan decisions. The platform automates loan approval processes, reduces manual underwriting time, and provides a data-driven framework for risk assessment.

## **🏛️ Application Architecture & Data Flow**

The application follows a modular structure:

1. **emi\_prediction\_dataset.csv**: The raw dataset of 400,000+ financial records.  
2. **utils.py**: A central module containing all helper functions for:  
   * Data Loading (load\_data)  
   * Data Cleaning (clean\_data)  
   * Feature Engineering (engineer\_features)  
   * Metric Evaluation (eval\_...\_metrics)  
   * Prediction Preprocessing (preprocess\_for\_prediction)  
3. **app.py**: The main landing page for the Streamlit application.  
4. **pages/**: The directory containing all other app pages:  
   * **1\_Data\_Explorer.py**: Loads and visualizes the clean data.  
   * **2\_Model\_Training.py**: Runs the entire E2E training pipeline, saving artifacts (.joblib, .txt) and logging to MLflow.  
   * **3\_Live\_Prediction.py**: Loads the saved artifacts and the "best" models from the MLflow Model Registry to perform live predictions.  
5. **mlruns/ (Generated by MLflow)**: The local directory where all MLflow experiment data, metrics, and model artifacts are stored.

## **📈 Model Performance**

All models are trained on a 70% split and evaluated on a 15% validation split. The best-performing models (XGBoost) are registered and used for the live prediction page.

## **🛠️ How to Run This Project**

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine.

### **1\. Setup**

**Clone the repository (or download the files) to your local machine.**

**Create a virtual environment:**

python \-m venv venv

**Activate the virtual environment:**

* On Windows:  
  .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate

* On macOS/Linux:  
  source venv/bin/activate

**Install all required libraries:**

pip install \-r requirements.txt

### **2\. Run the Application**

This is a two-part process: you must run the **MLflow UI** *and* the **Streamlit App** in separate terminals.

**Terminal 1: Start the MLflow UI**

In your *activated* terminal, run:

mlflow ui

Open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://127.0.0.1:5000) to view the MLflow dashboard.

**Terminal 2: Start the Streamlit App**

In a *second activated* terminal, run:

streamlit run app.py

*If this fails due to environment issues, use the more explicit command:*

python \-m streamlit run app.py

Your browser should automatically open to the Streamlit app.

### **3\. Application Workflow**

1. **Train Models:** Once the app is running, navigate to the **🚀 Model Training** page from the sidebar.  
2. Click the **🚀 Start Full Training Pipeline** button. This will take several minutes. It trains all 6 models, saves the scaler and encoder, and logs everything to MLflow.  
3. **Check MLflow:** Go back to your MLflow UI ([http://127.0.0.1:5000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://127.0.0.1:5000)) and refresh. You will see all the new runs (e.g., XGBoostClassifier, RandomForestRegressor) with their metrics.  
4. **Get Live Predictions:** Navigate to the **🔮 Live Prediction** page. The app will automatically load the best models (XGBoostClassifier, XGBoostRegressor) from MLflow.  
5. Fill out the form and click "Predict" to see the results.
